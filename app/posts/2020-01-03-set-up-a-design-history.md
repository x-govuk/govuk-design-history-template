This project makes it easy to:

* create pages of screenshots to document designs
* document designs using the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)
* print pages of designs
* make designs shareable and linkable

The project is built using the [Eleventy static site generator](https://www.11ty.dev/), meaning your design history site can be adapted as a service grows. This post describes how to get started.

## Install

Start by making a copy of this project. The easiest way to do this is on GitHub. Visit the [the govuk-design-history repository](https://github.com/x-govuk/govuk-design-history), and click ‘Use this template’. You’ll be asked to choose a GitHub user or organisation that should own this new repository, and a name for your copy.

To start making changes, you’ll need to download the repository to your own computer. Assuming your GitHub user is `my-username`, and you called your repository `my-service-design-history`, using the Terminal you would type:

``` text
git clone git@github.com:my-username/my-service-design-history.git
```

Next, change into the downloaded folder, and install all the dependencies needed to run the design history project. Do this by typing the following:

``` text
cd my-service-design-history
npm install
```

## Preview

Before uploading your design history to a public URL, it can be useful to preview it locally, on your own computer. To do this type:

``` text
npm start
```

Once all the files have been generated, a URL will be shown which you can enter into your browser’s address bar (usually this is <http://localhost:8081>).

Whenever you add a new post, or edit an existing post, the browser will automatically refresh the page with any changes applied.

## Customise

Before adding posts, you’ll probably want to customise a few things for the site to make sense for your service.

### Change the name of the website

1. Open the file `app/_data/app.js`
2. Change the value for `productName` to the name you want to use. This name will appear in the header, and in page titles.

### Update the homepage

1. Open the file `app/index.md`
2. Change the value shown for `title`. The value you give here is used for the large heading shown at the top of the page
3. Change the value shown for `description`. The value you give here is used for the text that appears below the title. You can also remove this line if you don’t want to show anything here.

### Update the footer

If you want to link to other tools your team uses, you can place these links in the footer.

1. Open the file `app/_layouts/base.njk`
2. Near the bottom of this file, you’ll notice there is a Nunjucks component called `govukFooter`. The design history project uses components from the GOV.UK Design System, and this is an example of that. Follow the [guidance on the design system website for how you can adapt the footer](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/footer/) to suit your needs.

## Document

You’re now ready to start documenting your designs. To add a new post:

1. Create a new file in the app/posts folder. Files should be named using the format `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`, where:

    * `YYYY` is the year
    * `MM` is the month
    * `DD` is the day
    * `slug` is the text you want to appear in the URL

    For example: `2020-02-19-first-designs.md` will create a page that can be reached at `<your-design-history>/first-designs/`

2. Posts are made up of 2 parts: a frontmatter and its contents.

    A frontmatter starts and ends with `---` and is written using a key/value data format called YAML. In most cases, you will only need three bits of information: `title`, `description` and `date`. For example:

    ``` yaml
    ---
    title: First designs for a minimum viable service
    description: A minimum viable service that could allow the providers to access and manage their ITT applications.
    date: 2020-02-19
    ---
    ```

    The content portion of a post uses Markdown, a lightweight markup language used to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. You can [learn more about writing Markdown with this guide](https://www.markdownguide.org).

3. Save the file, and visit the browser. You should see your new post listed on the home page.

## Launch

[Make things open, it makes them better](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles#make-things-open-it-makes-things-better). You can do this by deploying (or uploading) your design history to a third-party host. This project includes support for 2 different services, Heroku and Netlify.

### Heroku

Follow this [guide on connecting a GitHub repository to Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration). This is the easiest way to ensure changes are automatically deployed once they are merged to the default branch.

The process is very similar to [setting up a prototype on Heroku](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/publishing-on-heroku).

#### Password protect your design history

We’ve found it’s better to keep a design history public. But if you need to password protect yours, you can add a username and password using environment variables (Heroku calls these “config vars”):

* set `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` environment [variables on your Heroku app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars#managing-config-vars)
* update the [`Procfile`](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile) in the root folder with the following content:

```text
web: http-server --username $USERNAME --password $PASSWORD -p $PORT
```

### Netlify

Follow this [guide on deploying websites to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/). When asked for a build command, use `npm run build`.
