# Design history for GOV.UK services

A place for you to document your GOV.UK service designs.

<https://design-history.herokuapp.com>

## Purpose of this project

This repository makes it easy to:

* screenshot your designs
* create pages of screenshots to document designs
* document designs using the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)
* print pages of designs
* make designs shareable and linkable

## Installation

* Clone this repository to a folder on your computer
* Open Terminal
* In Terminal, change the path to the repository
* Type `npm install` to install the dependencies

## Working locally

Most of the time you'll be adding new posts. If you're just doing this then:

* Open Terminal
* Type `npm start`

This will automatically restart the application with any changes to your posts an any images applied.

If you want to make changes to CSS and JavaScript, and watch for those changes, run `npm run dev`.
